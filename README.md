# maven-release-tools
Script and meta file to simplify the release process for maven-based projects

The script in this repo can be called directly to release a VEuPathDB Maven-based Java project.  Call as follows:

`curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VEuPathDB/maven-release-tools/main/release-project.sh && bash release-project.sh`
